Plot.ly Challenge:

I build an interactive dashboard (https://nnorman312.github.io/Plot.ly/index.html) to explore a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Within the dashboard, I complete the following:
- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual
- Create a bubble chart that displays the bacteria cultures per sample
- Create a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual
- Display the individual's demographic information and each key-value pair from the dataset
